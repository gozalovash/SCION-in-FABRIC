# SCION-in-FABRIC
Research project on Implementing SCION in FABRIC testbed. All the configuration is in the jupyter notebooks.
This work has been produced using the tutorial by Anapaya: https://scion--4435.org.readthedocs.build/en/4435/tutorials/deploy.html 

## Creation and Configuration

Make sure to run the  SCION_Topology_Creation.ipynb  first to have configured the environment. Replace the names in curly braces with the correct values, and read comments in case anything has to be done inside the node. When the topology is ready, run the SCION_Configuration.ipynb to configure the SCION protocol on the nodes. Please make sure to have all the necessary topologies and configuration (toml) files in place. For full configuration details see the tutorial in the link above.
